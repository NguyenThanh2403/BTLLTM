# Tanks-Java-2D-Multiplayer-Game

This is a simple Java 2D Multiplayer Tanks Game using sockets. It is a client/server game.

The game is diveded into two seperate projects, one for the game server and one for the game client. 

The used IDE is netbeans (I uploaded all project artifacts), also the game executable JAR (client and server) files are uploaded. 

If you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so :)
